# Corrupt-File-Detector

The objective of this project was to seperate corrupt log files out of the user's file directory. The valid logs contained a certain pattern in the first line of the file. Using grep, the program finds all the files that have valid first lines. After the valid logs are found, they are organized based on year. The program adds a name improve the readibility and organization of the log files.
